# Week 1 Recap

Hello Folks,  
Happy Saturday. Let’s do a Week 1 recap:

- Your A-1 and final project have been released. Make sure to read them carefully.
- Your group has been formed. You will use this group to complete your assignments and final project.
- I have created a technical help discussion to assist you with any issues you may encounter while completing the installation guide. Please make sure all your installations are complete prior to the next class.

## For Week 2, we will:

- Do our Lab 1 based on our two SQL lectures. Make sure to at least complete all sections of SQL Lecture 1 (until 5.3) and read through the second SQL lecture. Both lectures will be crucial for your A-1 and Quiz 1. Also, as I said in the last class, the two SQL resources I shared will help you follow along with the lectures.
- Complete all SQL lectures on Monday. Make sure SQL and Docker are up and running on your end to minimize debugging time during the lecture.
- On Wednesday, start the ETL pipeline lecture. Lectures 4 to 6 will be posted in the meantime as well.

## Some housekeeping:

- In order to submit lab submissions, you need to attend the class.
- We will adjust the installation guide and code if you face any issues or errors. If you encounter any errors, please let me know.

Cheers,  
Asif
