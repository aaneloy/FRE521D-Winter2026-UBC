    "\n",
    "1. **Enable WSL 2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux)**\n",
    "   - Open PowerShell as Administrator\n",
    "   - Run: `wsl --install`\n",
    "   - Restart your computer when prompted\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Download Docker Desktop**\n",
    "   - Go to: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/\n",
    "   - Click \"Download for Windows\"\n",
    "   - Run the installer (Docker Desktop Installer.exe)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Install Docker Desktop**\n",
    "   - Follow the installation wizard\n",
    "   - Ensure \"Use WSL 2 instead of Hyper-V\" is checked\n",
    "   - Click \"Ok\" to proceed\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Start Docker Desktop**\n",
    "   - Launch Docker Desktop from the Start menu\n",
    "   - Wait for the whale icon in the system tray to stop animating\n",
    "   - Accept the terms of service\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Verify Installation**\n",
    "   - Open Command Prompt or PowerShell\n",
    "   - Run: `docker --version`\n",
    "   - You should see something like: `Docker version 24.x.x`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### For Mac Users\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Download Docker Desktop**\n",
    "   - Go to: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/\n",
    "   - Click \"Download for Mac\"\n",
    "   - Choose the correct version:\n",
    "     - **Apple Silicon** (M1, M2, M3 chips): Download \"Apple Chip\"\n",
    "     - **Intel**: Download \"Intel Chip\"\n",
    "   - To check your chip: Click Apple menu, select \"About This Mac\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Install Docker Desktop**\n",
    "   - Open the downloaded .dmg file\n",
    "   - Drag Docker to the Applications folder\n",
    "   - Open Docker from Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Grant Permissions**\n",
    "   - Click \"Open\" when prompted about the application from the internet\n",
    "   - Enter your password to allow privileged access\n",
    "   - Accept the terms of service\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Start Docker Desktop**\n",
    "   - Docker will start automatically\n",
